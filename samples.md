## Eulogy

Today, we gather to celebrate the life and legacy of Norman Downe, my grandfather, a father, grandfather, great-grandfather to many here and a friend and gentleman to all.
Norman was born at a time that witnessed the shaping of a generation marked by resilience, sacrifice, and an unwavering commitment to duty. His father, Charles was a motor engineer and his mother Lillie, a housewife and secretary, who always described her son Norman as a responsible and reliable man. To the end, Grandad’s roots were firmly grounded in education, family and responsibility.
A middle child, younger brother to Laurence who worked at London Heathrow Airport and older brother to his sister Daphne who later took the name Helen when she became a nun in the Roman Catholic Church, it is perhaps no wonder that grandad joined the Royal Air Force in 1940. While details of his wartime experiences remain shrouded in silence, we honour his service, dedication, and sacrifice. Grandad, stood among those willing to give up their today for our tomorrow, but was among the few who’s today lasted well past the end of war for what have been an incredible 102 years.
Grandad pursued his education, attending evening classes to become a quantity surveyor. He saw education as his way forward in a world that saw a lot of hardship. His work ethic and determination led him to a fulfilling career with the Ministry of Works, leaving a lasting legacy from Sarawak to Bahrain and notably the Danang to Dankuta road in Nepal, a feat of engineering cutting through the Himalayan terrain. His meticulous attention to detail extended seamlessly into his everyday life, where even the simplest queries about a meal would elicit responses measured in grams or ounces.
It is actually thanks to Ealing Abbey, and more specifically the Homefield Club, that Norman met Daria, the mother of their children. They raised four children - Peter, Julia, Terry, and John, in the UK and the middle east. Always impressing the value of hard work and responsibility, Norman would spend an hour and a half each day each way getting to work and back in Croydon to provide for his family whom he loved. By 1964, the family had settled in Ealing which, to this day, remained Norman’s home.
It wasn’t all work with Norman. When he wasn’t outrunning his grandchildren to the Uxbridge road, his interests spread from history, literature to music. Always humming, Norman clung to a tune for such time, one could divide his life into the Elton John period, the Abba era or the Phantom of the Opera eon. He was also a keen golf player once upon a time and remained an active social member of the Ealing golf club for most of his retirement.
If Ealing was his home, Grandad carried on traveling well after work. During his retirement he would explore and found happy companionship along the way. He went on organised trips to Croatia or local, yet perhaps more adventurous, expeditions to the Notting Hill Carnival. He loved Toulouse in particular and would often visit when my father, brother and I were living there.
As everyone knows, Norman was very sociable and witty. When came gin-o-clock, he would often remark that water could be detrimental to someone with an iron constitution such as his. He greatly enjoyed picking up on an odd phrasing and watching you with a twinkle in his eye.
As you can tell, Grandad understood the importance of language and the written word. Breakfast was not only a hearty meal for him but also the perfect opportunity to peruse the newspaper or to indulge in the word game known as Polygon by himself or with his visitors. If I may being in the house of god, aside from the Bible, Fowler's Dictionary of Modern English usage was his bible. However his edition was a few decades out of a date which always caused a stir when playing scrabble. If the words put forward by his children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren were not always listed in his dictionary, we were firmly told they did not count.
Norman was ahead of his time. Here was a man who grew up still seeing the odd horse and carriage for transportation who suddenly became tech-savvy during his retirement. He would set up his webcam to skype us and maintain close contact with family. His passion for bridge continued even into the digital age, playing on his computer to practice for tri-weekly games. This way, he could be at his sharpest when playing at the Brentford Club, Ealing Golf Club and even here at Ealing Abbey bridge club.
Grandad was independent and active for as long as possible, namely thanks to his wonderful carers, Chris, Chris, Marie-Anne and Ifrah. We recall having to plead with him to stop driving in his late 80s and rely on public transport instead. Later on, when public transport was no longer an option, Chris would drive him around. His trips to withdraw cash became known as heists as he would jokingly tell Chris to keep the engine running while he went inside the bank.
In the last few years, Grandad depended more and more on his wonderful carers. Even in those moments, his eyes would sparkle when you told him a joke, perhaps in an Irish accent, he enjoyed good food and spirits until the end. Although hard to see, he clung to life as long, or longer, than humanely possible, appreciating the wonderful gift it is.

I am also conscious of Grandad’s concern for accuracy and brevity.
Although we cannot say helloooo, let us not say farewell either. Norman created a 102 years’ worth of wonderful memories that will last a lifetime, our lifetimes. He left his mark upon this earth and we all carry forward lessons and values he imparted, be it a sense of purpose, a renewed commitment, some much needed perspective or a desire to pursue what is meaningful. Let us also take the time to enjoy the little and simple pleasures in life, a game of cards with friends, a picnic in the park, a well-constructed limerick or a West End show. Live life as he did, to the fullest and longest.
Rest in peace, Grandad. You will forever hold a special place in our hearts.

Client Type: Private
Project scope: Refurbishment of a residential property (contract value of 1
million and proposed floor area of 350 square metres).
Consultant/design team: Architect and Planning Consultants.
Current work stage: 3
Project Description: The property is a Grade II Listed Edwardian terrace. We
have been commissioned to design a high quality internal fit out by a private
client.
The buildings is a four storey residential dwelling located within the
Bloomsbury Conservation Area, but are not listed.
No.5 John Street forms part of a terrace of 8 houses built between 1754-59.
The terrace is characterised by stock brickwork facades with pedimented
doorcases to the main entrances and decorative cast iron railings with finials
to the street. Fenestration follows a typical pattern of 6-over-6 sashes to
ground and first floor with 3-over-3 sashes to the top floors. A secondary stair
to the front lightwell provides access to the basement entrance and pavement
vaults.
Internally the building retains many of its original features at ground and first
floor levels, including heavily moulded doors, architraves and skirtings and
decorative plasterwork to ceilings and walls. The staircase from ground to
second floor retains its original Chinese style balustrade and scroll mouldings.
The front room at second floor retains original cornicing, architraves, doors
and linen cupboards either side of the chimney breast. No original features
are present in the rear rooms at second floor and the entirety of third floor,
these having been remodelled previously.

work on several of these. Most of these jobs are either completed or at
construction phase.
The building at no. 3 Sloane Court East is a six storey residential dwelling
(including basement level) built in the early 20th century. The two buildings are
located within the Sloane Square Conservation Area, but are not listed.
The brief is to rationalise the internal layout so as to convert these houses into
luxury apartments, and have large lateral conversions above ground floor,
partial remodelling or complete rebuilding of the rear extension and a full
refurbishment. Given the very poor condition the non-original rear extensions,
the proposal is to demolish them and rebuild new extensions more in keeping
with the original design.
Background: The practice (G+P) have been appointed to produce a new
design for a 6 unit scheme and submit for planning following a previous
application submitted by another architecture practice was given consent by
the council.

Project Tasks: being drafted.
Sustainability:
The project is aiming for a Very Good rating in BREEAM.

Client Type: Private
Project scope: Refurbish second floor flat and new roof extension.
Consultant/design team: Architect.
Current work stage: 3
Project Description: The building is located in South West London, opposite
Kensington Olympia Station.
The brief is to reorganise the space so as to plan it more generously with the
new roof extension. It will remain a 3-bedroom flat but with larger en-suite
bedrooms and a larger open plan living space.
Current Stage: I was working on surveying and the initial design, before
planning.
Project Tasks: All the followings tasks were supervised by an Architect.

1. Planning history Research.
2. Historical research of the site and surrounding area.
3. Visited the site to take photographs and survey so as to draw up an existing
   set of drawings.
4. Prepared options for the client to review and worked with the client to
   achieve the desired design, under the supervision of an architect. This
   involved sketch options as well as AutoCAD drawings to illustrate various ideas

Project scope: Demolition and rebuild of 5 terrace houses in South West
London (contract value of 5 million and proposed floor area of 1480 square
metres).
Consultant/design team: Architect, Structural Engineers, M&E Engineer,
Historic Building Consultant, Tree Consultant, Daylight Consultant,
Environmental Consultant and Planning Consultants.
Current work stage: 3
Project Description: The site is located on Lancelot Place in an area of mixed
urban form and historic fabric. The scheme involves the reconstruction of 5
terrace houses over 5 storeys (sub-basement, lower ground, ground, first and
second floors) with an elevator for accessibility.
The brief is to design the layout for one terrace so as to replicate it on each
house. The houses must be of a modern interpretation of the existing terraces
that will be demolished as well as being in keeping with the architecture along
the street, without resorting to pastiche.
Current Stage: The project began in 2010. It has been in Pre-Application stage
as the developer has gradually bought each of the 5 terraces over the years
and so the design has been evolving with the new site conditions every time.
There has been a new development where the house at no. 11 has a covenant
from no. 15 preventing it from being any larger than what it already is.
Therefore, I was working on finding a reasonable solution in March.
Project Tasks: All the followings tasks were supervised by an Architect.

1. Prepared a Pre-Application advice enquiry presentation for the council.
   This included a detailed history of the area, an analysis of the context as well
   as how this informed the design, an explanation of the design process and
   material selection, the drawing package (existing/proposed plans, elevations
   and sections) as well as some 3D diagrams, sketches and visuals.

Client Type: Private - Developer (expert client).
Project scope: Demolition of existing detached house and rebuild as 8 unit
building (contract value of 1 million and proposed floor area of 654 square
metres).
Consultant/design team: Architect and Planning Consultants.
Current work stage: 3
Project Description: The site is located within Willesden in a mostly residential
area. We have been commissioned to design a new build 8 unit building to
replace a 1950's detached house that is in poor condition.
The brief is to maximise the site so as to incorporate 8 units and be in scale
and in keeping with the adjacent houses. The front elevation, being visible from
the street, needs to incorporate common features along the street, such as
bay windows and canopy entrances.
Current Stage: The project began in March. I have been involved quite majorly
from the start.
Project Tasks: All the followings tasks were supervised by an Architect.

1. Prepared a new design based on council's comments after previous pre-
   application enquiry.

The Smart Motorways Programme (SMP) is an initiative spearheaded by
Highways England (formerly known as the Highways Agency) with a total
funding of £10b each year. It is an initiative to transform the current motorway
network into a smart motorway network. A smart motorway has new types of
digital signages and emergency areas along the road whilst the hard shoulder
is turned into a running lane. This means new gantries and assemblies need
to be built all along the road and the hard shoulder sometimes needs widening.
This is achieved gradually through multiple construction projects all along the
motorway, treated as separate schemes. These construction projects usually
cover roughly 20km of road per scheme and will cost on average a total of
£100m but can cost anywhere up to £1b depending on the complexity and
size of the particular scheme (sometimes covering 50km of motorway). Each
project takes 2 to 5 years to complete. The works are usually contracted by a
private company that are on a government framework appointed by Highways
England and often follows a design & build procurement route. A design team
of engineers will either be provided or sub-contracted to design the SMP
scheme.
Project Tasks: Bryden Wood is working on this project for Highways England (formerly
known as the Highways Agency). We have been sub-contracted by Costain.
It is a bespoke consulting services contract worth £700k and insured up to
£10m. Its duration is 7 months, lasting from September 2017 to March 2018
and our title under this contract is "Systems Integrators" and our deliverable is
the Rapid Engineering Model (REM).
The Bryden Wood project team for REM is comprised wholly of Architects,
each of whom has a complimentary background in computational design. The
team has had no previous experience of infrastructure design. This
‘freshness’ has allowed the team to develop a radical new approach to
automated design.
The digital workflow is developed as a group at a strategic level, with individual
team members taking ownership and responsibility for specific elements.
In this project the ‘output’ (i.e. work product) is not the design of a particular
scheme, but the digital process for designing many schemes. The novelty is
that this automated design work flow is the output. It is more common for a
design practice to ‘internalise’ such approaches in order to deliver
efficiencies but in this case the digital process is, ultimately, for the client use
(and therefore direct benefit).
All the following tasks were supervised by an Architect.

- I designed, put together and presented an extensive workflow diagram which
  lays out the computational methodology behind the rule-based automated
  process of REM
- I sketched out a process which evaluates topographical data along the
  motorway and scripted it in an automated workflow, and implemented an
  automated visualisation process
- I developed a detailed automated workflow which determines the visibility at
  each position on the road, given any highways scheme
- I developed a BIM workflow which automatically populates a BIM model with
  the proposed motorway layout resulting from the entire REM process
- I attended a series of internal meeting in order to develop an optimisation
  workflow which will determine the best positions for assets along any input
  scheme, using the result of the evaluation process
- I developed and scripted the optimisation algorithm agreed upon in internal
  team meetings
- I produced an animation which explains the REM process and a
  drivethrough video of an example scheme run using REM and put together a
  video used to illustrate the entire project
- I started to develop a detailed user diagram (a roadmap of the REM process
  explaining how to use the tools and processes developed together)

All the following tasks were supervised by an Architect.

- I updated the extensive "road map" flow diagram to include new processes
- Continuing to develop and debug the processes I originally created in the
  last period as problems occurred when applying them to the different new
  schemes (M1 J35a-J39, M42 BBM4 and M1 J19-23a)
- I developed a new automated design process where the frame points used
  for analysis along the road can be generated. Whereas before these were
  being generated inside the topographic analysis definition and subsequently
  regenerated in the following definitions that might need them, they can now be
  generated at the beginning, exported to Excel and then read in subsequent
  definitions.
- I developed an automated process which generates a mesh of the
  topography based on the survey CAD received
- I developed a design output review tool to assess, visualise and interact with
  the automated output from the REM process by engineers
- I developed a new distance analysis workflow which measures "key
  distances" between assets and assesses those
- We ran a workshop with the client to demonstrate to them the use of the tool
  so far in order for them to get an understanding on how to use as well as the
  mechanisms behind it. We used the M1 J19-J23a scheme to run the
  definitions and processes on and explain the methodology at each step. This
  was useful for us too as the client was able to validate as well as interrogate
  our process at a high level of detail. In these workshops, I was responsible for
  running and explaining the workings of the definition that generates frame
  points along the road as well as the topographic and environmental evaluation
  definitions. This was 3 days of working very closely and collaborating with the
  client on this project because we were running each step together and
  working as a team. This was a very important step for us as a team because
  we are getting closer to actually handing over the tool. This was also invaluable
  for me as professional to be able to interact with the client in much the same
  way as you would with a traditional construction project, except with a project
  and about a "product" that is radically different to that, being an automated
  design tool.
- I updated the animated video explaining the REM process to include a
  drivethrough of the M42 BBM4 scheme which we have been working on.

All the following tasks were supervised by an Architect.

- I worked on the visibility analysis workflow whereby target points can be
  paired with their furthest available observer points
- I cleaned up and annotated/commented the visual scripting files behind all
  the automated design and analysis workflows that I have been responsible for
  since starting this project in anticipation for the handover of those files
- I was then responsible for writing extensive documentation for each of the
  workflows mentioned - this meant documenting and diagramming the
  processes surrounding them / inputs and outputs
- Once all the documentation was checked, we built an online documentation
  website to host it so that the client can access it from anywhere
- I was responsible for preparing the files for issue. The issue was in two
  phases two weeks apart - the REM processes followed by the documentation
- Shortly after issuing, we began extensive workshops which are described in
  inside the "A1 J6-J8, Welwyn-Wymondley/M62 J20-J25, Rochdale-
  Huddersfield/M25 J10-J16, Greater London" project
- From this workshop, the client provided us with extensive and detailed
  feedback on the documentation from which we were able to update it
- Furthermore, we were asked to prepare a seperate document called the
  "User Guide" which I helped reviewing after it was compiled

The client has requested that we run REM on a live SMP scheme which they
intend to deliver. Through our contract with Costain, we are sub-contracted as
consultants on this scheme. What they want is for us to generate a layout for
this scheme so that they can compare the results from REM with the layout
designed by their team of engineers.

- I ran the workflow to generate the BIM model for the three iterations
  The M1 J19-J23a is a smart motorway project that Highways England have
  already designed a layout for and want us to run our analysis on in order to
  check that their designed scheme is sound. It is a stretch of the motorway that
  is 50km long and contains six entry and exit junctions as well as a motorway
  service area. It also contains a total of 86 bridges extending above or below
  the motorway.
  Project Tasks: All the following tasks were supervised by an Architect.
- We produced three iterations and I ran the workflows that extracts data from
  each iteration, eventually generating a geospatial data model
- I ran the workflow to generate the BIM model for the three iterations
- I was responsible for collating all the geometrical information in a shared
  model to display for the client
- I was responsible for getting all the files together to send to the client in the
  official issue of this scheme

The client has requested that we begin running REM on real SMP schemes
which they intend to deliver at some point in the future. Through our contract
with Costain, we are sub-contracted as consultants on these schemes.
Highways England gave us these three new schemes to use in the handover
workshops where we explain the REM process to the client. Through
workshops, we took the client through the entire process which we have called
REM1+, being the first version of REM that we will be handing over.
The A1 J6-J8 is a stretch of the motorway that is 15 km long and contains two
entry and exit junctions as well as a motorway service area. It also contains a
total of 18 bridges extending above or below the motorway.
The M62 J20-J25 is a stretch of the motorway that is 34 km long and contains
five entry and exit junctions as well as a motorway service area. It also
contains a total of 37 bridges extending above or below the motorway.
The M25 J10-J16 is a stretch of the motorway that is 34 km long and contains
six entry and exit junctions as well as a motorway service area. It also
Project Tasks: contains a total of 47 bridges extending above or below the motorway.
All the following tasks were supervised by an Architect.

- I prepared and participated in a five day workshop with the client, running
  the entire REM process on the A1, M62 and M25 schemes - rather than
  simply showing, this workshop involved overseeing the client complete the
  process too
- I ran the initial session taking client through processing/editing the DTM
  survey received
- I was partly in charge of running the subsequent sessions where we took the
  client through the analytical and evaluation workflows
- I assisted in taking the client through the environmental analysis session
- After the design layout automation session, I co-led the interactive workshop
  with the highways engineers to review the design output
- I was also responsible for taking the client through the workflows that extracts
  data from each iteration, eventually generating a geospatial data model
- I was responsible for getting all the files together to send to the client in the
  official issue of this scheme

All the following tasks were supervised by an Architect.

- I have the role of coordinating all data analysis and evaluation operations for
  the project. I have become first point of contact for the client in relation to this.
- I listed all the new topographic layers that will be necessary to analyse in the
  next phase of REM as well as sketching out the geometrical formulas to do so,
  ready to present to the team.
- I initiated, ran and minuted a team meeting to discuss the above and hear
  new ideas which could enhance the process.
- I designed the analytical and computational processes for measuring some
  of these layers as well as kept up to date on the progress of the other
  analytical layers in progress with my team.
- As I progressed with transforming my outlined geometrical methodology into
  a computational one for producing these new topographical data layers, I kept
  a record of how this translated and created new sketches to explain this
  process in our weekly presentations.
- I exchanged several emails and attended meetings with the client in order to
  confirm thresholds for the evaluation of the new analytical layers.
- I suggested a more accurate and time-efficient way of processing the
  survey which we receive into the geometry which we use to run REM. This
  meant a restructure of all the model layers and the curves used for analysis.
- In order to implement the above, I ran tests and exchanged emails as well as
  attended meetings with the client to approve this new method. Once
  confirmed, I coordinated the transition to the new survey model process with
  the team.
- I worked on an interactive model which checks an input layout against the
  Highways England design guides and visualises the relevant topographical
  and environmental data to make live decisions.
- During this period, a major objective was to connect the REM process to our
  JSON database. I was responsible for testing this database connection. After
  which I was responsible for implementing the database link throughout the
  process.
- I worked on a script which converts mesh geometry into JSON data which
  we can upload to our database.
- I reworked the parametric system in which the topographical mesh is
  generated in order to increase its accuracy.

In the last period, the client requested that we begin running REM on real
SMP schemes which they intend to deliver at some point in the future.
Through our contract with Costain, we are sub-contracted as consultants on
these schemes. This period, they requested drivethrough videos for both
schemes based on the initial REM output and the subsequent iterations made
by the engineering team during the interactive workshops held last period.
Aside from the placeholder project which we were using to develop our
automated, rule-based design tools for smart motorways (which was M1J23a-
J25), the M42 BBM4 scheme is the first project on which we tested our tool
from scratch to produce a smart motorway layout for HE within a week of
receiving the survey information from them. It is a stretch of the motorway that
is 15km long and contains four entry and exit junctions as well as a motorway
service area. It also contains a total of 20 bridges extending above or below
the motorway.
The M1 J35a-J39 is the second real project that HE gave to us, in parallel with
M42 BBM4, to run our definitions on and deliver outputs that they were able to
review. It is a stretch of the motorway that is 24km long and contains four
entry and exit junctions as well as a motorway service area. It also contains a
total of 34 bridges extending above or below the motorway.
Project Tasks: All the following tasks were supervised by an Architect.

- I gathered all the models needed for topography, bridges, junctions as well
  as the automatically generated BIM model of the latest iteration
- I created an automated pipeline that will generate 3D text tags for each asset
  along the road so they can be identified easily in the drivethrough
- I built drivethrough sequences through the combined model and exported
  those as image sequences which I then put together and edited
- I was then responsible for gathering these video files ready to be issued to
  the client

The client has requested that we run REM on a live SMP scheme which they
intend to deliver. Through our contract with Costain, we are sub-contracted as
consultants on this scheme.
Project Tasks: The M1 J19-J23a is a smart motorway project that Highways England have
already designed a layout for and want us to run our analysis on in order to
validate the engineers' current design. It is a stretch of the motorway that is
50km long and contains six entry and exit junctions as well as a motorway
service area. It also contains a total of 86 bridges extending above or below
the motorway.
All the following tasks were supervised by an Architect.

- I undertook the responsibility of running this scheme through several
  workflows that I have either created or worked on
- I generated and checked the topographic mesh of the scheme
- I ran and checked the visibility analysis workflows on this scheme
- I was also in charge of running the topographic and environmental data
  evaluation workflows for this scheme
- I was responsible for collating all the information together within a
  Navisworks overall model to submit to the client
- I was responsible for getting all the files together to send to the client in the
  official issue of this scheme

The client has requested that we begin running REM on real SMP schemes
which they intend to deliver at some point in the future. Through our contract
with Costain, we are sub-contracted as consultants on these schemes.

entry and exit junctions as well as a motorway service area. It also contains a
total of 34 bridges extending above or below the motorway.
By running our tools on these projects, we intend to deliver a series of layouts
which are "optimised" based on the topographic data available and the
thresholds provided by HE to evaluate that data. This can then be used as a
basis for the design team to use and base their decisions on, along with all the
data that we gather and visualise. These will then be modified and iterated
over several workshops between the HE engineering team and ourselves until
a solution is reached.
All the following tasks were supervised by an Architect.

- I undertook the responsibility of running this scheme through several
  workflows that I have either created or worked on
- I generated and checked the topographic mesh of the scheme
- I ran and checked the visibility analysis workflows on this scheme
- I was also in charge of running the topographic and environmental data

- I prepared the layout output for generating the BIM model of all the assets on
  the road and then ran the BIM generation process on this scheme
- I was responsible for collating all the information together within a
  Navisworks overall model to submit to the client
- In this 3 month period, we had 4 submissions for both of these schemes and
  I was responsible for getting all the files together to send to the client

Bryden Wood were appointed by Vastint to apply an automated design
methodology on an ‘Illustrative Masterplan’ from another architect which
described the proposed uses, scale, layout, conceptual arrangement of the
public realm and access for the site.
The proposal is to regenerate a former brewery site of 6.6 hectares providing
many new city-centre homes, offices and other workspace surrounding a
new, generous park. With the exception of access, the following summarises
the content of the outline planning application:
Project Tasks: - Up to 850 residential homes (use class C3)

- 85,000m2 business floorspace (use class B1)
- Up to 15,000m2 Flexible Uses including retail (use class A1); financial and
  professional services (use class A2);
  restaurants and bars (use class A3 and A4); hot food takeaway (use class
  A5); business floor space (use class B1);
  non-residential institution (use class D1) and assembly and leisure (use class
  D2)
- Up to two hotels with a maximum of 400 beds (use class C1)
- A minimum of 2 ha of public realm, as a contribution to the City Park, plus
  additional public and semi-private open
  spaces
- Vehicular access to the site
- Car and cycle parking, including the provision of basements.
  This task was supervised by an Architect. I helped sketch out and finalise the
  illustrative diagrams outlining various design rules that can be used to form an
  automated design approach for resolving the masterplan based on:
- Spaces between buildings creating pathways
- The orientation of the buildings which can transform these paths
- The shape, size and location of public open areas and green spaces which
  can be carved out of the buildings
- Adding or removing mass which can reshape the site
- Applying varying facade types which project out of the building mass by
  different lengths based on planning permission
- Locations, size and shape of windows and balconies (ordered/ random,
  dispersed etc...)
  The diagram shows how all of these rules can be manipulated based on
  environmental analysis, 3D visibility analysis (isovist), pedestrian flows and
  more.

CREE is an Austria-based manufacturer, which produce a unique timber-
hybrid modular construction system. This project was a bid from Bryden
Wood to work on a automated design platform that clients can use to
strengthen as well as shorten the entire design process through AI, data
analysis, automation and the repeatable components within the modular
construction system that CREE can provide. The idea is to allow clients to
easily and rapidly access unique and integrated design, production and
assembly processes so that the core and shell milestone of a project can be
achieved faster than when using conventional building methods. This would
have the potential to reduce cost massively in the initial stages of a design
project as a feasibility study and business case would be generated
automatically.
Project Tasks: This task was supervised by an architect.
I designed, illustrated and narrated the bid poster which was presented to
CREE, describing each step the platform could offer. Relevant diagrams,
prototype user interface and data dashboards that would help the design
process at each stage. The steps included:

1. Scenario: automated translation of scenario and requirements into
   diagrams and useful data which can point towards appropriate sites (inputs
   here would be type of building, maximum occupancy, floor to floor ceiling
   height, city...)
2. Location: here we access every available piece of information from
   different open data sources to explore the geographic profile of the city and
   choose from appropriate sites for this particular development.
3. Site: geospatial analysis of particular site for design considerations (public
   transport, private access, traffic, urban grain, public open spaces, retail,
   amenity provision, sediment analysis, social media, deprivation scores, site
   morphology...)
4. Volumetric analysis: specific site is tested against the scenario with all its
   requirements, initial feasibility studies undertaken and generated in order to
   translate the requirements of the scenario into spatial conditions. Site specific
   volumetric/environmental analysis is carried out to maximise the scheme's
   success based on those conditions.
5. Building type: based on massing, a library of building layouts is generated -
   the process here is an automated iteration through a list of building typologies,
   the output a number of site specific 3D diagrammatic building options.
6. Design with CREE: technical design can be resolved rapidly and efficiently
   here iterating through the library of CREE components.
7. Build with CREE: design analysed for construction, schedule of
   components generated, construction process simulated with cost and
   timeframe to produce business case to sell units to early investors (virtual
   reality and augmented reality to visualise the development).
8. Local manufacturer: find local manufacturers adapted to this particular
   project - supply chain, authorised architects, contractors, suppliers...

The Smart Motorways Programme (SMP) is an initiative spearheaded by
Highways England (formerly known as the Highways Agency) with a total
funding of £10b each year. It is an initiative to transform the current motorway
network into a smart motorway network. A smart motorway has new types of
digital signages and emergency areas along the road whilst the hard shoulder
is turned into a running lane. This means new gantries and assemblies need
to be built all along the road and the hard shoulder sometimes needs widening.
This is achieved gradually through multiple construction projects all along the
motorway, treated as separate schemes. These construction projects usually
cover roughly 20km of road per scheme and will cost on average a total of
£100m but can cost anywhere up to £1b depending on the complexity and
size of the particular scheme (sometimes covering 50km of motorway). Each
project takes 2 to 5 years to complete. The works are usually contracted by a
private company that are on a government framework appointed by Highways
England and often follows a design & build procurement route. A design team
of engineers will either be provided or sub-contracted to design the SMP
scheme.
Bryden Wood has a new direct appointment from Highways England. It is
again a bespoke contract worth £1.2m and is insured up to £10m. Its duration
is 8 months lasting from August 2019 to March 2020. In order to get a direct
appointment from a government body, the practice needs to be on a
government framework which is renewed every 4 years. This direct
appointment was made possible because the practice is already on the
Ministry of Justice Framework due to another ongoing government project
currently in the office. The title we have under this appointment is "Systems
Integrators" on this project and our deliverable is the third version of Rapid
Engineering Model (REM3).
Although REM2 was set to be completed in March in our original contract, we
were awarded a contractual extension to complete it as the scope grew.
Therefore, there is an overlapping period between REM2 and REM3 which
officially ended in September but realistically continued until October.
The Bryden Wood project team for REM is comprised wholly of Architects,
each of whom has a complimentary background in computational design. The
team has had no previous experience of infrastructure design. This
‘freshness’ has allowed the team to develop a radical new approach to
automated design.
The digital workflow is developed as a group at a strategic level, with individual
team members taking ownership and responsibility for specific elements.
Project Tasks: In this project the ‘output’ (i.e. work product) is not the design of a particular
scheme, but the digital process for designing many schemes. The novelty is
that this automated design work flow is the output. It is more common for a
design practice to ‘internalise’ such approaches in order to deliver
efficiencies but in this case the digital process is, ultimately, for the client use
(and therefore direct benefit).
All the following tasks were supervised by an Architect.
REM2:

- I coordinated with external engineers to develop automated workflow which
  aims at providing the most efficient drainage elements within the space
  available along the road as well as vehicle restraint barriers within the space
  available at each position
- I sketched out the workflow described above as a sequence of drawings in
  order to illustrate the process to the external engineering team
- I developed an parametric workflow which places construction platforms for
  proposed assets inside of the existing topography mesh
- I attended an inter-disciplinary workshop with the client as well as engineers
  and architects where, with the help of engineers, we tied up loose ends for
  finalising REM2
- I gathered all the feedback from the workshop, continued making contact
  with the external engineers and client by email and phone in order to make the
  appropriate amendments to the REM2 process for the final submission
- I produced a drivethrough video of a motorway scheme which merges
  images of the REM data model of the scheme and realistic images of the
  proposed model
  REM3:
- I attended inter-disciplinary workshops with the client as well as engineers
  and architects aimed towards discussing the scope of REM3 in terms of
  drainage, vehicle restraint barriers and bridges
- I attended a kickstart meeting for a project where all the DMRB (Design
  Manual for Roads and Bridges) Standards will be uploaded to a cloud
  database by the client so that we can connect them directly into our REM
  processes as parameters in order to receive automatic updates of revisions
- I designed an extensive map of which clauses from the DMRB Standards link
  to which parts of the REM process
- From the map, I set up a data structure solution in our database which point
  to where to find the data linked to clauses in the DMRB database inside the
  relevant REM processes
- I helped coordinate the creation of an app which will let the user of REM
  keep track of the clauses used in the DMRB database and accept revision
  changes or new clauses
- I developed a clause change control solution by which accepted clause
  changes can be implemented inside the REM processes
- I attended daily progress reports with the client, external computer scientists
  and solution architect who are delivering the DMRB database
- I attended bi-weekly internal progress report meetings and presentation with
  the team, occasionally with the client joining

Silvertown is a mixed-use development aiming to provide thousands of new
homes in South-East London. There are four plots developed by three
different architects which gained planning permission in the last couple of
Project Tasks: years. These projects are part of the Silvertown Quays Regeneration
development spearheaded by Lendlease. The total redevelopment of
Silvertown Quays is worth £3.5b. Each plot is estimated to cost between £75m
and £150m and contains 2-4 buildings. These projects reached planning
under dRMM, Maccreanor Lavington and Pollard Thomas Edwards.
Lendlease is a professional client which generate a yearly revenue of £15b.
They have worked with Bryden Wood in the past and therefore appointed us
to work on four projects as “Civil & Structural Engineer, MEPH Engineer and
Executive Architectural Services”
. The work consists of developing a DfMA
approach in order to deliver the project. The idea is to apply a rapidly
deployable DfMA structural grid system developed by Bryden Wood called
"platforms" to the building designs picked up from the previous architects. In
addition, a full MEP layout is to be developed across all the projects. Not only
this, but automated workflows are to be developed to increase efficiency
across a range of projects. There are two teams working on the project, the
architecture and MEP team which are directly involved in the design and the
technologies team which are developing the automated workflow as a digital
tool for "residential platforms" and I am part of the latter.
The technology team for this project is comprised wholly of Architects, each
of whom has a complimentary background in computational design. Much of
the team has had no previous experience of MEP. This ‘freshness’ has
allowed the team to develop a radical new approach to the automation of such
outputs. The project team are entirely made up of Architects and Engineers.
Silvertown Quays is a 27.4 hectare site located to the south side of the Royal
Victoria Dock, within the London Borough of Newham, East London. It is the
largest undeveloped brownfield sites remaining from the Royal Docks’ closure
in the 1980s, and one of the last parts of the London Docklands to be
redeveloped. It falls within the Royal Docks Enterprise Zone which is an
Opportunity Area within the London Plan and a strategic site within the
adopted Newham Core Strategy.
All the following tasks were supervised by an Architect.

- I attended a team meeting introducing me to the project where I was
  presented the automated workflow so far and able to comment on its progress
- I reviewed the current automated workflow and tested it by using it to
  recreate the design of one of the plots (ongoing refinements throughout the
  period)
- I worked on improving the accuracy of the automated workflow in terms of
  achieving the desired apartment mix
- I attended a debriefing whereby the MEP team set out all the elements they
  would expect as an output and how they would design those elements with an
  example apartments - these included ventilation, fire sprinkler system, soil
  pipes, plumbing, switches, lights, electrical sockets in a diagrammatic layout
- I liaised with MEP engineers and designed ventilation layouts for different
  apartment configurations in one of the plots
- Based on my static ventilation layout iterations, I developed an automated
  process which produces dynamic ventilation layouts for any given apartment
  type
- I helped develop the BIM database structure where all the information about
  each output component of the design can be saved to be rebuilt inside any
  BIM software and tested it in Revit
- I set up a workflow and structure to transform the Revit model from the
  architect into points, lines and parameters that can be computed in our
  workflows in order to automate the MEP layouts for the entire project
- I attended a progress report meeting to explain what I had implemented in
  the automated workflow, how the processes worked and why they fulfilled the
  brief given to us by the MEP engineers

105 Sumner Street is a commercial development aiming to provide new
offices that will serve the upcoming Southwark market nearby with modern
and flexible office accommodation. The project gained planning permission in
2017 with another architecture practice called Piercy & Company.
Landsec is a professional client with an overall property portfolio worth £13b.
They have worked with Bryden Wood in the past and therefore appointed us
to work on the project as “Multi-Disciplinary Designer”
. The work consists of
developing a DfMA approach in order to deliver the project. The idea is to
apply a rapidly deployable DfMA structural system developed by Bryden
Wood called "platforms" to the building design picked up from Piercy &
Company. Not only this, but automated workflows are to be developed to
increase efficiency across a range of projects. There are 2 teams working on
the project, the architecture team which are directly involved in the design and
the technologies team which are developing the automated workflow as a
digital tool for "office platforms" and I am part of the latter.
The technology team for this project is comprised wholly of Architects, each
of whom has a complimentary background in computational design. This has
allowed the team to develop a radical new approach to the automation of office
building structures. The project team are entirely made up of Architects.
Project Tasks: The existing site comprises two buildings, 105 Sumner St, 133 Park St and the
car park service yard in between them. Both buildings were in use until
demolitions started in October, the first was a warehouse and the second an
office block. The project lays out the demolition of the existing buildings on the
site and redevelopment comprising the erection of two office (Class B1)
buildings ranging in height from five to ten storeys plus rooftop plant, creation
of a new basement, new access and servicing arrangements, creation of a
new courtyard and provision of a retail (Class A1/A3/A5) kiosk, hard and soft
landscaping and other associated works. The cost of the works is estimated
between £60m and £70m. The procurement route is management contracting
with several consultants being appointed directly by the client.
All the following tasks were supervised by an Architect.

- I attended a team meeting introducing me to the project where I was
  presented the automated workflow so far and able to comment on its progress
- I helped develop the BIM database structure where all the information about
  each output component of the design can be saved to be rebuilt in any BIM
  software and tested it in Revit
- I attended a design critique session organised by the architecture team
  where they updated us on the progress of the project in terms of design,
  planning and construction
  Client Type: Private.
  Project scope: Refurbishment of our office space in a Grade II Listed Building
  concerning ground and lower ground floors (contract value of 200 thousand
  and proposed floor area of 314 square metres).
  Consultant/design team: Architect.
  Current work stage: 3
  Project Description: Holborn Hall is an early 20th century Grade II listed
  building that was built as the Town Hall and Public Library for the borough of
  Holborn, now located within the borough of Camden. This is a refurbishment
  project that went into planning for our own offices on the ground and lower
  ground floor of the building. We are renting these spaces and so the objective
  was to obtain planning permission as well as permission and financing from
  the landlord.
  The proposal is to insert a small spiral stair, to link the studio space on ground
  floor (former Public Meeting Space) with lower ground office areas. As well as
  a complete renovation and re-organisation of the work space, the installation of
  a shower and new tea point was proposed.
  Background: The practice (G+P) have been occupying the rear office space
  on the ground and lower ground floors of Holborn Hall since 2001 after they
  completed the original renovation into office units of the entire 20th Century
  building.
  Planning: A planning application for the project was sent in October and
  amended within the same month. Camden Council should be have a decision
  by mid December. I have been involved in the application from the start and
  have produced the drawing package and Heritage Statement, under the
  supervision of two architects.
  Project Tasks: All the followings tasks were supervised by an Architect.

1. Listing and planning history research.
2. Responsible for the production of the Drawing Package (existing/proposed
   plans, elevations, sections and construction details of the spiral stair).
3. Responsible for drafting the Heritage Statement.
4. Preparing and submitting the planning planning application on the Planning
   Portal. This included all the existing/proposed drawings and the heritage
   statement. The planners also asked for some detailed drawings of the
   proposed spiral stair at 1:5 and how we would propose to fill the hole, should
   the stair ever need to be taken out.

Client Type: Private - London Estate (expert client).
Project scope: Refurbishment of two residential Listed Building properties
(contract value of 2.5 million and proposed floor area of 322 square metres,
per property).
Consultant/design team: Architect, QS, Structural Engineer, M&E Consultant,
CDM Consultant and Party Wall Surveyor.
Current work stage: 5
Project Description: The Estate, our clients own the freehold on several
properties on Manchester Street. We have been commissioned to work on several of these. These jobs are all at construction phases. They are all Grade
II listed Georgian townhouses with later extensions to the rear and non-original
unsympathetic internal partitioning forming several small units. The brief for all
of these is to rationalise the internal layout in keeping with the original design,
partial remodelling or complete rebuilding of the rear extension and a full
refurbishment. Given the very poor condition the non-original rear extensions
presented Nos. 44&45 were consented complete rebuilding of the extensions
by planning.
Background: The practice (G+P) have been appointed as lead consultant
including contract administration duties. G+P have been responsible for
chairing meetings since feasibility stage. There are two planning applications
for each property, where the latest added minor changes and amendments.
Procurement: A cost plan was submitted to the client at each stage of the
works. The quantity surveyor is carrying out a monitoring role throughout the
construction to provide early warning of cost risks.
Current Stage: The project started on site in early September. The contract
period is 50 weeks. My involvement in the project started a few weeks after
works began on site.
Project Tasks: All of the following tasks were carried out under the supervision of an
Architect.

1. Drawing construction details.
2. Amending drawings within the construction package, after comments made
   by the Lead Architect. Several details were not working and had to be
   considered in more detail, this involved solving a roof detail from scratch and
   amending various parts of other details where the architect indicated.
3. Researching and proposing cheaper alternatives for the light fittings and
   amending schedules within the Construction Package.
4. Organising and updating the digital and physical file for the project with the
   current drawings.

Client Type: Private.
Project scope: Refurbishment of an office space for a financial investment
company (contract value of 500 thousand and proposed floor area of 286
square metres).
Consultant/design team: Architect, QS, M&E Consultant and CDM Consultant.
Current work stage: 3
Project Description: The Millbank Tower in London is a 33-storey Grade II
Listed Building. The World Bank Group, our client previously appointed us for
the fit out of their offices on the 12th Floor of the Millbank Tower. Here, we
have been commissioned to work on the fit out of their offices on the 20th
Floor, with a more open plan design. The brief for this is to rationalise the
internal layout in order to maximise the work space, using an open plan design
for the central office space. Also, an executive office, a conference room, a
break out space, a kitchen, an it room and two quiet rooms were also
requirements included in the brief.
Project Tasks: All of the following tasks were carried out under the supervision of the team
leader.

1. Participating in visiting site and surveying.
2. Involved in the design process of the general layout, feature screen within
   the reception space and the feature wall at the centre of the office space.
3. Responsible for the production of part of the Drawing Package
   (existing/proposed plans and reflected ceiling plans).
4. Production of a 3D model of the proposed design on SketchUp as well as
   the production of visuals. This helped us figure out the joinery design, as well
   as the feature screen and wall as we were able to prepare several iterations in
   detail.
5. Visited specialist carpet manufacturer's showroom to pick out relevant
   carpet samples in accordance with brief given by client. We then selected a
   few carpet options from that which were presented to the client.
6. Attended meeting with M&E engineers to discuss services how the reflected
   ceiling plans are achievable with the proposed services.

Client Type: Private - London Estate (expert client).
Project scope: Refurbishment of two residential properties and conversion into
lateral apartments (contract value of 1.5 million and proposed floor area of
1032 square metres).
Consultant/design team: Architect, Services and Structural Engineer and
Planning Consultants.
Current work stage: 3
Project Description: The Estate, our clients own the freehold on several
properties around the Sloane Square area. We have been commissioned to
work on several of these. Most of these jobs are either completed or at
construction phase.
The buildings at nos. 39 & 41 Sloane Gardens are five storey residential
dwellings built in the late 19th century. The two buildings are located within the
Sloane Square Conservation Area, but are not listed.
The brief is to rationalise the internal layout so as to convert these houses into
luxury apartments, and have large lateral conversions above ground floor,
partial remodelling or complete rebuilding of the rear extension and a full
refurbishment. Given the very poor condition the non-original rear extensions,
the proposal is to demolish them and rebuild new extensions more in keeping
with the original design.
Background: The practice (G+P) have been appointed to produce a new
design for a 6 unit scheme and submit for planning following a previous
application submitted by another architecture practice was given consent by
the council.
Current Stage: The project started in October. I have been involved in the
project from the start.
All the followings tasks were supervised by an Architect.

1. Planning history research. Because a previous scheme had already
   received planning permission, the idea was to see how we can work from that
   scheme. Ultimately, this scheme was not what the client desired and so none
   of it was taken into account.
2. Prepared options for the client to review and worked with the client to
   achieve the desired design, under the supervision of an architect. This
   involved sketch options as well as AutoCAD drawings to illustrate various ideas
   and concepts.
3. Responsible for the production of the Drawing Package (existing/proposed
   plans, elevations, sections on PDF sheets to send to the client and the design
   team).
4. Prepared several schedules of area, each step of the way, comparing the
   existing, previous architect's design and our various iterations.
5. Prepared fire strategy plans and sections to comply with part B of building
   regulations.

Client type: London Estate (expert client).
Project scope: Old building being refurbished with a pub at ground floor and
flats above (contract value of 4.5 million and proposed floor area of 1000
square metres).
Form of appointment: The SFA/99 is used with some of the clauses removed
as required by the client.
Procurement route: JCT Standard 2011 with Quantities with some amendments
to form of contract as required by the Client.
Consultant/design team: Architect, QS, Structural Engineer, M&E Consultant,
CDM Consultant and Party Wall Surveyor.
Current work stage: 4
Cadogan Arms is an existing retail unit currently arranged over two floors
located in a Conservation Area in Chelsea. Redevelopment proposals form part
of a larger mixed residential and commercial project to redevelop Nos.
296-298 King’s Road and 60-62 Old Church Street. Proposals for the
Cadogan Arms comprise refurbishment of the retail unit, removing partitions
and opening up to create a more efficient pub/restaurant area with new
shopfront.
Retail units are to be finished to shell and core, ready for incoming tenant fit-
out, as requested by the client. Residential proposals span across two floors
and comprise a total number of five flats.
Planning: Pre-planning advice was completed and planning proposals are
being drafted.
Sustainability:
The project is aiming for a Very Good rating in BREEAM.
Project Tasks: All of the following tasks were carried out under the supervision of the team
leader.

1. Made amendments on the floorplans, as instructed by architect.
2. Production of a 3D model of the proposed design on SketchUp as well as
   the production of visuals.

## Reflections|

Task performance & learning during this period of experience
Working in practice was a big change from the academic world of architecture. Although I had been
prepared for it through several summer internships, this placement year opened my eyes to the world of
professional architecture and I have learnt a lot from it.
In terms of software, my CAD skills have already vastly improved and I have a better understanding of
lineweights and standard layering systems, as well as various commands which I was not familiar with
before. My 3D skills have also improved as I have created and edited various models during my first three
months with Garnett+Partners. I have also learnt about the filing system here and the document control
system here.
I have also gained more attention to detail when planning a residential or commercial floor layout. Various
considerations in planning these types of spaces have been brought to my attention whilst working on these
projects and my knowledge of this type of design has been enriched by it. I have learnt about the
collaborative process between the architect and the client and understand better how the relationship
works, creating several iterations according to client feedback until eventually the desired design can be
reached.
Site visits were also of great benefit to my continuing development as an architectural student because I
was able to see the sites with an architect present and have his input on the site's potential etc. Visiting a
construction site was even more useful as I was able to see how our drawings translate into real action, as
well as the Lead Architect's comments on how the building site is being managed.
Personal development & role performance evaluation
I think that the most insightful way to gain knowledge when starting at an architecture practice is to learn
through observation and then apply that knowledge to your work. I had the advantage of having had some
experience working in an architecture practice before during summer internships. I was able to get into
action fairly rapidly, although observing how this specific practice functions was very helpful in determining
my role within it.
My CAD skills were sufficient to complete the initial basic tasks that i was given, in which I was able to gain
confidence in my skills and began to take on more complex tasks. My knowledge of CAD was fairly limited
in comparison with the practice's expectations initially but I was able to learn rapidly and caught up with the
pace within a couple of weeks from starting. My 3D skills matched those expected in the practice and so I
was comfortable with the 3D tasks from the beginning which I completed to the satisfaction of the
supervising architect and well within the deadlines.
Having worked on various projects at different work stages allowed me to get a feel for the diversity of the
professional architectural world and the various skills required to be able to tick all the boxes adequately.
What I found challenging when working in practice was balancing various tasks at once whilst having to
meet tight deadlines. However, I was able to overcome this by managing my time efficiently and was able to
meet my deadlines and juggle between projects with ease.
Aims for next period of experience
During my next period of experience, I hope to improve my skills and work more efficiently still. I hope that
I will continue being involved in the design stage of projects but also in the construction stage so as to
increase my knowledge of drawing details.
In addition, I am excited to pursue the projects which I have been working on during the past three months.
I want to see them develop and maybe even see some through to completion such as the 20th Floor
Millbank Tower project as it is a small interior design project.
Further skills needed and actions to take to achieve aims
I would like to further improve my CAD skills and learn more about the standard layering system which the
practice uses (based upon the guidelines of BS 1192 Part 5). I have enjoyed being involved in the planning
stage of projects as I am able to be involved in the initial design which is a skill that I would like to develop
during my work here.
Most importantly, I would like to learn more about the construction stage of projects. In working on drawings
at that stage, I will further develop my understanding of the layering convention and by attending
construction site visits, I will learn more about how our drawings are executed in the real world.
Additional student comments, support required from placement provider
It has been especially interesting to be in London for my placement as it is such rich and diverse architecture and there is always plenty to discover.

Task performance & learning during this period of experience
My understanding of the professional world of architecture has been expanding since I started here and it
has still continued to grow during my second period of experience.
In terms of software, my CAD skills have continued to improve and my understanding of the industry
standards has grown. I have also learnt about the presentation side of a drawing, how to lay drawings out
on sheets properly etc. My 3D skills have also continued to improve as I have created and edited even
more models than during my first period of experience as I have learnt to be more efficient.
My design approach has also been enriched by these last few months' experience. I have learnt about how
to deal with existing buildings as well as new builds, in the residential and commercial sectors. Industry
standards in terms of spatial layouts have been brought to my attention and I have learnt a lot from the
London Housing Guide and Lifetime Homes standards, which are necessary documents to comply with in
order to receive planning permission for all new builds. My understanding of the planning process has also
improved as I have been involved in numerous planning applications/pre-applications during this period of
experience.
Site visits were also of great benefit to my continuing development as an architectural student because I
was entrusted as the person to investigate potential sites and buildings. This was both interesting in terms of
seeing different parts of London but also as a detailed examination of a certain site or building.
Personal development & role performance evaluation
I was given more projects during this period of experience as well as more responsibility within each
project. I was working with a variety of clients, some of which we regularly do work for and others were
new, some developers and some individuals.
My CAD skills have improved and they have been adequate at completing the tasks given, I have been able
to complete tasks at a faster pace now and well within the deadlines given. My 3D skills have been put to
the test even more so during this period of experience, I completed 2 site models and 2 detailed models of
our proposals, along with several iterations of these. The visuals I produced from them were very
presentable and were used to illustrate our ideas to the client every step of the way.
I have had no trouble meeting deadlines and have learnt a lot about time management and prioritising your
work when under pressure. I have been well within the deadline for each task and have given myself more
than enough time to check through my work which has been very helpful.
Aims for next period of experience
During my next period of experience, I hope to further improve my skills and productivity. I hope that I will
be involved in more new projects as well as continue to work on the ones that I have been particularly
interested in.
I would like to do more site visits, I visited a lot of sites for new projects to photograph and document them
which has been very enjoyable. I would like to continue this but also visit more construction sites so as to
learn more about the construction side of our business.
Further skills needed and actions to take to achieve aims
I would like to further improve my sketching skills as this has been a valuable tool in the production of Pre-
Application Enquiries for the council. For this, I need to continue visualising my ideas in sketch form as
well as produce neat sketches of a finalised scheme ready for presentation.
I would still like to learn more about the construction stage of projects. In visiting construction sites, I will
learn more about how our drawings are executed in the real world. I have note been able to attend any
construction site during this period of experience but I hope that I will be able to attend some during my
next one.

Task performance & learning during this period of experience
I have adjusted very well into the working environment of the practice and feel very comfortable being part
of the team and handling projects.
My CAD and 3D skills have been more than adequate to complete all the tasks I have been given and in
good time. My productivity has been on the rise and I have been able to get out of the office more on site
visits etc.
What was interesting during this period of experience was all the times I was able to go on site visits. I was
able to learn about photography as I was in charge of photographing the sites. For the job on Percy Street,
I was given access to the roof top of a house on the street running parallel to Percy Street so as to get high
level photographs to do a photo montage of the extension.
Personal development & role performance evaluation
During this period of experience, I have been given fewer projects to work on but I have been given more
responsibility within each project to deliver high quality Pre-Application Enquiry Reports. I was able to have
a real input on the initial design and then entirely responsible of drawing packages as well as Design &
Access Statements and all the research that goes with it.
My understanding of the software has continued to improve and my work has been of good quality, the
architects have been very happy with what I produce.
I learnt a lot during this period by visiting sites and potential sites, investigating the areas etc. Indeed, I was
responsible for photographing various potential sites and investigating the surrounding areas to give an
idea of the contextual architecture as well as inspiration. My photography skills improved but also I learnt
how to identify important features of a site/existing building and how to investigate the surrounding
efficiently.
Aims for next period of experience
During my next period of experience, I want to continue doing site visits and taking interesting photographs.
I enjoy investigating the surroundings of a site as I discover new architecture, especially as the sites I visit
are mostly in central London and the diverse architecture that it has to offer.
I would like to continue working on planning but also continue working on the projects that I began working
on during this period of experience and potentially be involved in a tender package.
Further skills needed and actions to take to achieve aims
I would like to develop my architectural photography skills as well as my investigative skills. The way to
accomplish this is simply to do more site visits and record these visits through photographs.
I would still like to learn more about the tender stage of projects. To achieve this, I would like to be involved
in a tender package of one of the projects that i worked on originally in the planning stage as it would be of
particular interest to me. This is fairly unlikely though as most of these projects are still in the Pre-
Application stage.

Task performance & learning during this period of experience
My final period of experience has been very useful as I was able to work on a wider variety of projects as
well as having more responsability within certain projects.
I was able to put into practice all the skills I've learnt this year with a lot more design freedom and in more
various stages of the process.
I was able to work on a lot of construction details and visit sites that are in progress as well as completed. I
learnt a lot about the whole process from this.
Personal development & role performance evaluation
The level of responsibility I was given has increased as I was able to visit construction sites and comment. I
was able to contribute to the discussion when coming up with technical solutions to construction issues.
The design freedom I was given during this period has also increased in terms of the planning applications
I was allocated to. I was entirely responsible for planning layouts for certain projects

Task performance & learning during this period of experience
Having spent the entirety of my Masters course focusing on computational design, I was fortunate to find a
workplace where the theories that I had learnt about can be put into practice on real projects in the UK.
However, the academic setting of such work flows is very different to when it actually has to be put into
practice. What I have learnt is that this sort of approach is very difficult to put in practice because it is
largely untested and developers have not yet been presented with enough evidence to prove that it is worth
their while, which is also why there is not so much of a big market for it in architectural practice and yet it
is extensively researched academically.
Essentially, the project I have been working on to develop smart motorways for Highways England is one
of developing automated processes. This means that we do not selling a finished product like most
architectural projects but a continually evolving process that they can use and re-use again and again.
Through this, I have learnt a lot about automated, rule-based design and optimisation algorithms which can
have further architectural applications as they are repeatable.
I have learnt about new ways of capturing topographic and data based on 3D surveys such as road
curvature, gradient, side grading, super elevation and so on. I have also learnt what these datasets mean
and how they can be understood and used in the context of motorway projects. I have learnt how to use
and effectively categorise big data automatically in a more efficient and consistent way across a project
and how these large datasets can actually have a constructive impact on a project.
In terms of digital skills, I have learnt the basics of Dynamo in Revit which I had never used before. I have
learnt a great deal more in Grasshopper and especially coding in Python. I have learnt how to treat data
more efficiently and effectively by structuring it in data trees in Grasshopper and structured lists in Python.
Having been self-taught with these tools, I had picked up many bad habits which were quickly addressed
and amended upon joining the team here, where everyone is familiar with these tools.
Personal development & role performance evaluation
There was a fairly steep learning curve when I started as my fellow team members have more experience
than me in computational design and programming languages, especially when applied in a practice
setting. However, I was able to overcome this and get up to speed quite quickly as the team I joined was
very helpful and took time to explain things to me thoroughly before starting on any task that seemed
outside my skill set.
It has been a very different experience from working in a traditional architecture practice for my part 1
placement in that the timeframe for projects is a lot longer. One aspect of using a computational approach
is that a lot of it is experimenting and discovering new processes as a result of that experimentation.
Therefore, we haven't had any hard deadlines yet and so it has been fruitful to have the time to really
explore different ideas.
I feel I have comfortably found my role within the team at a time when it is growing quite quickly as we are
able to provide more and more evidence for the validity of our approach to clients in a variety of projects
and therefore able to secure more work.
Aims for next period of experience
In the next period of experience, Highways England will be giving us real smart motorway projects to test
the tools we have developed so far and review the layout designs that are generated. Whereas before we
were using a placeholder project of an older smart motorway project that Bryden Wood worked on in the
past, now we will be given real projects which need a smart motorway layout. We will be able to run our
automated processes to gather data, evaluate that data and produce an "optimised" layout with which they
will be considering for these projects.
My aim here would be to have an active role in dealing with the client in workshops where we explain the
tools in order to get there feedback and further improve our workflow. We will be workshopping our tool to
do manual adjustments to the generated layout with the Highways engineering team too which I would like
to have an input in either directly or indirectly.
Finally, we have talked about restructuring all the scheme data that we gather within the Smart Motorways project into a database. A whole new data structure has been outlined with our own naming conventions so
as to organise it more clearly as the volume of data now is exceeding what can be easily handled within
Excel with as the project has developed. If this goes ahead, I would like to have an active role in setting it
up.
Further skills needed and actions to take to achieve aims
I hope to continue learning as much as I have been since I started here, especially in terms of coding
languages. I have learnt a great deal in Python but would like to learn more to be able to code complicated
custom algorithms with structured lists, or data trees in Grasshopper. Also, I would like to learn C# as it is
processed a lot faster in Grasshopper but also can be used in Unity and to build applications outside of
Grasshopper. To do this, I will learn from my colleagues who are very knowledgeable in C# as well as
study tutorials in Visual Studio.

Task performance & learning during this period of experience
The last period of experience was about developing an automated design tool using an already completed
scheme as placeholder. This period, this automated design tool was really put into practice and tested on
real projects, where the outputs will be contributing to a real construction project. It is key to be able to test
on multiple projects to truly understand whether the automation part of the process is repeatable across
any project. Testing the tool on these schemes enabled me to debug many of the workflows I worked on in
order to truly allow any input to feed into them for multiple schemes.
I think I performed well with the responsibilities and tasks I was trusted with, which were considerably more
important than my last period as I was actively involved in workshops with the client as well as official
issues of our outputs. What I learnt was not limited to coding and video editing but how to communicate
these complex ideas that are encoded inside these automated processes to the client.
Personal development & role performance evaluation
In this period, I was able to interact with the client and be actively involved in official issues. My role is
indeed growing within the team. Client interaction has been useful for my professional development as well
as the evolving role I see myself growing into as I take on more responsibility.
The "Creative Technologies" team which I joined has grown from half a dozen people when I joined to
almost 20 now and the smart motorways team within that has grown from 3 people when I joined to 5 now. I
feel very comfortable within this growing team and excited by its growth as it suggests many more
opportunities to be involved in computational design projects.
I have felt that my scripting abilities were below the level of my fellow team members during this period
however and have begun to learn more on Python by doing tutorials in my spare time. This has really
helped improve my scripting skills in general. More specifically, I have been able to apply the knowledge in
debugging some of our existing scripts but also create new scripts from scratch when necessary.
Aims for next period of experience
In the next period of experience, I would like to again participate in workshops with the client as we will be
going through the last phases of the final handover for the first version of REM. Therefore, there will be
even more opportunities for client interaction in the next period and I will make sure to be a part of that.
As the team is growing and more projects are coming in, I will act curious and inform myself on what my
fellow team members are working and even involve myself if asked.
Having learnt a lot about Python in particular during this period through which I am now able to code fairly
complicated custom algorithms, I would also like to sharpen my skills in C# during the next period as it is
compiled faster than Python inside Grasshopper and therefore is more efficient for certain scripts.
Further skills needed and actions to take to achieve aims
I will make myself available and dynamically involved in order to help as much as I can with the handover
to the client. I will try to make the definitions and processes that I am responsible for within REM as clear
as possible for the transition to be as simple as possible because this is an extremely complicated project
to be handing over. I will refine my communication skills to be able to deliver this both in documentation
and workshops.
I have found a good interactive tutorial to learn C# online on SoloLearn.com which I will complete over the
next period in order to sharpen my skills.

Task performance & learning during this period of experience
In this period of experience, the novelty was in the actual handover process with the client. This has meant
a great deal of back and forth with the client and engineers, including workshops, presentations,
email/document exchanges and so on. Having now had many client interactions and learnt from those over
the last period, I think I performed quite well.
However, I was also exposed to new experiences as we were tasked with explaining our work over the last
year with a very high level of detail but also in a way that an engineer with little to no computer science
experience can understand. This was quite a challenge but it is so important with the type of architecture I
want to practice, where automated and computational workflows will be driving efficiencies and improving
the quality of construction projects through algorithmic pipelines and data modelling. These types of
workflows require rigorous explanation not only in the delivery but also during the briefing process for them
to have any value in a project - the client needs to know exactly what it is these workflows are doing if they
are going to work. What we realised during this process is that there were some long standing
misunderstandings that needed to be corrected at most steps of the REM process.
Personal development & role performance evaluation
Within REM, I am responsible for several of the workflows that together form the process of REM as well
as workshopping most of the workflows with the client. In addition, there have been several new motorway
schemes for us to test REM on and submit outputs to the client which I have also been involved in. This has
meant more client interaction which has certainly been enlightening and I think I have grown well into this
new side of my role.
Areas in which I feel satisfied are the maintenance/new features of REM workflows. I also feel satisfied
with how I have handled workshop and general client interactions. Where I could improve is in my
technical abilities as many members of the team are much further ahead than me in this respect. I could
also improve my time management to maintain my new workload as well as potentially take on new
responsibilities as my role may change going through my Part 3 education.
Aims for next period of experience
I would like to have more exposure to the contractual side of our business, as I am planning to take a
special interest in the issues of intellectual property for my Part 3 when we are selling a process to clients
rather than a finished product.
I would like to further develop REM as we enter into a new contractual phase with the client. This will be in
terms of data analysis and evaluation, model editing and a potential database connectivity.
However, my main focus can move to my potential case study project which is L&G modular housing or
other projects more linked to architecture directly where I can transfer what I have learnt from REM as my
Part 3 course starts in September.
Further skills needed and actions to take to achieve aims
On the Part 3 side, I want to start working on L&G housing project and be involved in a construction project
linked to this that I can use in my case study as well as gain experience with work stages 4 and 5, and
have interaction on the client side. All this whilst continuing work on REM part time and remaining a point
of contact for the client.
I would like to attend CPDs or training courses in contracts to develop my knowledge in this area to further
my research for my Part 3. I would also like to continue the weekly tutorials in C# and develop my
programming skills, perhaps through additional training courses also if these become available. In the next
year, I would like to gain knowledge and be involved in the contractual side of the business as I research
the issues surrounding intellectual property for my Part 3 case study.
On the technical side, I want to develop my skills in C# so that I can build custom tools in Visual Studio to
be used in multiple projects across the team.

Task performance & learning during this period of experience
During this period of experience, I took on increased responsibility in the Smart Motorways project as our
direct appointment with Highways England took effect in August. This has meant a lot more client
interaction and communication through meetings as well as workshops.
Client communications have been successful for the most part. Although there was a miscommunication
which meant the client who was handling the data analysis for the M6 scheme had reversed the data
between the carriageways as opposed to the engineering team who had provided the proposed layout.
However, I was quick to point this out and made sure that it was rectified before we had the interactive
workshop with the entire design team where we were to present these findings. Therefore, no issue
resulted.
On a more technical level, the REM process has become a lot more intensive. It has been difficult to keep
up with the team in terms of technical expertise in computational processes. However, I have been able to
expand my knowledge of scripting in a way where I can start to tackle more and more complicated
problems using code.
Personal development & role performance evaluation
In this period, my role has evolved quite significantly and has involved a lot more communication with the
client, externally and internally. I feel I have taken on this new responsibility well and grown within the team.
However, during this period I have been awarded a title change from Architectural Assistant to
Computational Designer/Architectural Assistant reinforcing my position in the team and demonstrating that
I am representing the company well in promoting our ethos through this automated design approach.
What was challenging during this period of experience was the amount of workshops I was involved in,
with the client and externals. Particularly the workshop for the M6 scheme as I was dropped in with the
entire design team for the project, representing the entire company. However, this workshop was a
success and the client commented on how efficiently we worked together.
As an Architectural professional, it has been particularly useful to work on a project which requires
information and feedback from all disciplines. It allows collaboration/reviews and adjustments in real time,
meaning a lot of cross-disciplinary communications which I have been able to keep up with and will be
useful to continue to apply throughout my Architectural career. In order to be able to coordinate such a
project requires a good understanding of all the disciplines involved, which is a crucial role of the
Architect.
Aims for next period of experience
In the next period of experience, I aim to complete further workshops the client and design teams of Smart
Motorways projects. Although not only to validate specific layout proposal - we have discussed the
possibility of running workshops with Highways England, Costain and Jacobs in order to validate the
current REM process as well as investigate further design logic used by the engineers and try to abstract
them into more rules for use in the automated process. These will probably be running during my next
period of experience and I want to make sure I am involved in order to continue having an active role in the
implementation of new ideas within this project.
However, I am becoming aware that I may be lacking experience on the construction side of Architecture.
As we are developing a tool and not a built project, we do not oversee any construction and the projects we
are working on will only be delivered in 2020. I aim to maybe seek such experience on different projects
within the team and perhaps obtain a case study compatible project. In this project the output is not the
design of a particular scheme, but the digital process for designing many schemes. The novelty is that this
automated design work flow is the output. It is more common for a design practice to ‘internalise’ such
approaches in order to deliver efficiencies but in this case the digital process is, ultimately, for the client
use (and therefore direct benefit). This raises interesting issues around design ownership and liability (in
fact a significant part of the project has been around verification and validation of algorithmic processes)
which I would like to explore further through a similarly computational and process driven project which I
can base my case study on.
In a more general way, I am also looking to continue my work on the more technical side of this project by
completing the database implementation as well as keep improving the accuracy of our data analysis from
the outset of the process.
Further skills needed and actions to take to achieve aims
In preparation of these upcoming client workshops, I need to prepare all of my queries surrounding the
engineering team's process and begin a thought process in terms of problem abstraction. I can work on
this with the help of my fellow team members and try to understand the queries they may have within the
parts of the process they usually work on also.
More specifically in terms of REM, in order to increase the accuracy of the data analysis, I need to rethink
the way that we produce the topography mesh where a lot of data readings are taken from, as this process
simplifies the survey geometry and can stray form it to a varying degree along the road.

Task performance & learning during this period of experience
Since my last PEDR exactly one year ago, my progress has been significant. I have been able to design
and implement complex workflows that I would not have been able to do a year ago. The whole team's hard
work over the last two years had been recognised in the industry as we won the AJ100 Best Use of
Technology Award and the Smart Motorways project itself won the NCE TechFest Best Use of Technology:
Driving Efficiency in Design and Delivery Award. These awards further validate our place within the
architectural industry as doing work that is not only worthwhile but genuinely pioneering. This has given me
the confidence to determine the type of "Architect" I want to become and how I would want to practice the
craft. More generally, these are the key things I have learnt over the past year:

- Developing and improving his technical skills
- Self-management skills
- Taking more responsibilities and delivering successfully parts of the project
- Developing a critical approach towards the development of automated processes
- Improving communication skills with externals
  In this period of experience, I have had more involvement in a number of projects across the practice than
  ever before. In this way, I have been able to translate the robust automated methodology from the Smart
  Motorways project into the office and residential "platform" projects. My expertise in computational and
  automated design has increased, which is something that I have been able to stream into the development
  of new projects in the office.
  Presenting the work that I have been doing over the past two years to the new students at the MArch studio
  that I graduated from helped me put it all in the context of what I had been taught. It also allowed me to
  show the new students how the theoretical computational approach that they are being taught can have
  very useful practical applications.
  Balancing my part 3 studies, the Smart Motorways project, the office and residential "platforms" projects
  as well as a private job for a house extension has helped me develop my time management and planning.
  This has meant I have been working autonomously and taking increased responsibilities. The private job I
  have been working is in collaboration with another architectural assistant as well as an Architect who is
  checking our work and advising. This has meant I have been able to put into practice what I have learnt
  through the part 3 program about the considerations that go into a fee proposals, briefing, organising and
  the programming of services as well as actually delivering on those. Working in multiple projects in the
  practice has meant I have developed my team working skills and I felt I was able to quickly integrate each
  project team and became productive fairly early on.
  Personal development & role performance evaluation
  My role within the Smart Motorways project (REM2) has grown significantly since we began shortly before
  the previous PEDR and I have been able to successfully tackle the new challenges that have come with it. I
  have taken responsibility to create entirely new processes for new assets and analyses that we have been
  asked to produce from scratch. Through these newfound responsibilities, I have overseen communications
  and workshops with the highways engineering team and learnt the requisite technical skills to achieve what
  was set out.
  These responsibilities and undertakings have continued throughout this period as we move into the REM3
  phase of the project as well as taking more responsibility through smaller projects within REM3 such as the
  DMRB database connection project. In addition to this, I have been required to split my time between this
  project and the office and residential platform projects over this period, which I have been fairly successful
  at doing. I have been flexible with my time also, giving more time to the project that needs it the most at any
  given time.
  Areas where I feel I have been performing well are in client communications as well as technical skills in
  terms of finding efficient ways to abstract engineering design processes into automated processes
  following these communications with the clients. This has meant I have improved my programming skills
  technically, but also my understanding of problem abstraction has become a lot clearer. I could improve
  time management in the sense that I would not feel able to handle all the projects at once, if they all require
  time sensitive attention at the same time. However, this has not happened during this period as each
  project has required intense attention at different moments and I have been able to manage myself succesfully as well as work autonomously.
  Everything discussed previously I have enjoyed. The documentation process in closing out REM2 within
  the Smart Motorways project however was drawn-out and not so enjoyable. Even though it is a necessary
  part of the project as it is the main communication tool for the client to understand the REM process and
  how to use it, I felt there was additional work which we produced which could have been avoided if we had
  worked smarter. I think that we can improve the way that we deliver this piece of work in order to avoid
  designed and one online version, using a standard layout template. We had to duplicate our efforts here
  automate the production of the other for instance.
  Aims for next period of experience
  My main aspiration at the moment is to be more involved in my Part 3 architecture project (105 Sumner
  Street) while juggling my time with the Smart Motorways Project, the office and residential "platforms"
  projects. This will enable me to achieve my goals of becoming an Architect and encourage my development in terms of sharpening my skills, focus and time management.
  Essentially, I would like to continue working on REM for REM3 part-time while maintaining a good level of
  responsibility and continue to interact with the client and deliver crucial parts of the project. However, I also
  want to get some solid site experience with 105 Sumner Street, not only on the actual site but also in the
  factory where the "platform" components are being built as this is a DiMA project and the main site will be
  the factory.
  Additionally, I would like to continue to support the team across different projects as they become available
  and learn new skills in doing so.
  Further skills needed and actions to take to achieve aims
  It is crucial that I begin to understand the way that construction projects are shaped within the practice,
  particularly 105 Sumner Street in order to make progress on my case study. For this, I need to be more
  active within this project and set up a meeting with the architecture team to be briefed on the history of the
  project within the practice. This is my priority in order to complete my architectural education.
  In addition to this, I would like to further develop my technical skills as I continue to develop the residential
  and office "platforms" project. I am keen to see how this project can go on to inform a multitude of projects
  across the practice and so l would like to make sure that we continue to push this agenda and disrupt
  current workflows in the process.
  As mentioned, it is essential to make an effort to improve my time management skills as I am balancing
  many projects in and out of practice as well as gaining experience and preparing my case study. I have
  been able to work autonomously quite successfully over this period and this should have a positive impact
  on how I manage my time going forward.

title: "When Less Is More: Coding Like a Data Scientist"
date: "2025-04-19"
tags: ["data science", "machine learning", "best practice", "software"]

---

Having recently embarked on a machine learning bootcamp at the Machine Learning Institute (MLX), I've been struck by a fascinating contrast in coding styles. Having formally trained in software engineering quite recently, I felt a strange dissonance working with data scientists and how they write their Python code. It was so... lean. Almost sparse compared to the robust, defensive code I'm accustomed to writing. This observation sparked some interesting reflections about the different approaches these two disciplines take to solving problems.

### When two worlds collide

In my first week at MLX, we dove straight into neural networks, which was both exhilarating and slightly overwhelming. During the exploratory data analysis session, I examined my peers' code for how to evaluate features for our MLP model using a simple regression:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
df['log_price'] = np.log(df.price)
model = LinearRegression().fit(df[['log_price']], df.sales)
print(model.coef_)
```

Had this been my code, I'd have included error handling, logging, type hints, thorough documentation, and probably split it into multiple functions. What's worse, I'd have probably written a whole spec on how to write it before even starting. But here was the stark reality: this approach was _perfect_ for learning. While my software engineer instincts screamed for more structure, I realised this stripped-down style kept the focus exactly where it needed to be—on understanding the machine learning concepts, not the surrounding code architecture. It is about expressing that logic through simple code.

### Different priorities, different practices

This experience made me reflect more deeply on the fundamental differences between how data scientists and software engineers approach coding. It's not about skill or quality—it's about purpose.

Data scientists typically work in an exploratory, research-oriented environment. Their code serves as both a discovery tool and a means of communication. They prioritise readability, speed of iteration, and flexibility to test hypotheses quickly. Code that clearly shows each step in an analysis is more valuable than code that anticipates every edge case.

Software engineers, on the other hand, build systems that must withstand the unpredictability of production environments. Our code must be robust, maintainable, and scalable. We anticipate failure modes, build defensive code, and optimise for long-term maintainability rather than short-term clarity.

Consider how differently we might approach a data processing task:

**Software engineer's version:**

```python
import logging
from src.config import get_config
from src.utils.data_loader import load_data
from src.app.model import Model

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def main():
    try:
        config = get_config()
        data = load_data(config.data_path)
        model = Model(config.model_params)
        result = model.predict(data)
        logger.info("Prediction completed")
    except FileNotFoundError as e:
        logger.error(f"Data file not found: {e}")
    except Exception as e:
        logger.exception("Unexpected error")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The contrast is striking. Behind this code there is also a great deal of abstracted code that can run in the hundreds of lines compared to the 8 lines needed in the previous example. Both accomplish similar tasks, but with vastly different assumptions about context and purpose.

### Documentation: embedded vs external

In the data science world, I've noticed that documentation takes on a completely different form. Rather than extensive external documentation, data scientists embed their explanations directly within notebooks using markdown cells and descriptive variable names. The code and explanation flow together like a narrative, telling the story of their analysis.

As a software engineer, I'm used to maintaining separate README files, architecture diagrams, API docs, and even wikis. There's a clear separation between code and documentation. While this feels more structured and comprehensive, I can see how the integrated approach favours the rapid iteration that data scientists need.

### Testing: formal vs intuitive

One other difference I've encountered is the approach to testing. In software engineering, we live by our test suites—unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests—all automated and running in CI pipelines. Code without tests is considered incomplete at best, dangerous at worst.

Data scientists, however, take a more intuitive approach. Their "tests" might be visual checks of a plot, examining summary statistics, or simply rerunning cells to see if results make sense. They rely on the immediate feedback loop of the notebook environment to catch issues.

In our first week building neural networks, we didn't write a single formal test. Instead, we checked our implementation by sharing outputs and comaring with one another and visualising decision boundaries. Was it rigorous by engineering standards? No. But it was remarkably effective for learning and confirming our understanding.

### CI/CD: pipelines vs exploration

Continuous Integration and Deployment are cornerstones of modern software engineering. We build elaborate pipelines to ensure code quality, run tests, and deploy safely. Every pull request goes through this gauntlet before it can be merged.

Data science workflows, by contrast, are much more fluid. Version control might be used sporadically, or not at all. When it is used, changes are often pushed directly to main branches. Instead of feature development, branches might be used to develop parallel workflows. Code reviews are often conducted in person, looking at notebooks together rather than through formal pull request processes.

At MLX, I feel encouraged to experiment freely without these constraints. It feels almost rebellious coming from a structured engineering background, but I can see how it removes barriers to creativity and exploration.

### Dependencies: locked down vs flexible

In software engineering, managing dependencies is a critical discipline. We use lockfiles, containerisation, and separate dev/prod environments to guarantee consistent behaviour across different systems.

The data science approach is notably more relaxed. A simple requirements.txt or Conda environment often suffices, with less concern for exact version pinning. This flexibility allows for quicker setup and experimentation, albeit with the occasional "it works on my machine" moment.

During the bootcamp setup, we were given a relatively simple environment file without strict version constraints. While this would have made me a bit jittery normally, it worked perfectly for our learning environment where absolute reproducibility was less critical. The code simply needs to run on the specific dataset we need.

### Learning through simplicity

What has become increasingly clear during my bootcamp experience is that the data science approach offers distinct advantages when learning complex concepts like machine learning:

1. **Focus on concepts, not code**: With simpler code structures, more mental bandwidth is available for grasping the mathematical and statistical concepts.

2. **Immediate feedback**: Quick, iterative coding allows for rapid experimentation and immediate visualisation of results.

3. **Reduced cognitive load**: Without worrying about error handling, graceful fallbacks, modularity or passing tests, it's easier to concentrate on the transformations and algorithms themselves.

4. **Visible logic flow**: When code follows a clear, linear progression without abstractions, the core logic is clearly revealed.

In our first week at MLX, building neural networks from scratch, the focus wasn't on creating production-ready code but on understanding how neural networks operate, backpropagation and loss calculations. Had we been concerned with proper error handling and architecture, we likely would have missed the forest for the trees.

### Finding the right tool for the job

This isn't to say one approach is universally better than the other. Rather, each has its place. The data science approach optimises for learning and discovery; the software engineering approach optimises for reliability and maintainability.

As I progress through the bootcamp, I'm learning to appreciate both methodologies and context-switch between them. When I'm trying to understand a new algorithm or statistical concept, I will embrace the leaner style that prioritises clarity and exploration. When I need to integrate a model into a larger system, I will bring in the software engineering practices that ensure robustness.

The industry has already identified this need for a middle ground some years ago so I don't think I'm pointing out anything new here. The field of MLOps bridges these worlds, bringing software engineering best practices into the data science workflow while maintaining the flexibility needed for effective experimentation. Tools like DVC, MLflow, and even Pydantic help to formalise experimental work without sacrificing too much agility.

##ß# Final thoughts

Perhaps the most valuable lesson I've taken from this experience is the importance of adaptability. Efficient technical practitioners know when to apply rigour and when to prioritise exploration. As I continue my machine learning journey, I'm trying to cultivate both mindsets — using the right approach for the context rather than dogmatically sticking to either extreme.

Learning to embrace the lean, focused code of data scientists has been unexpectedly liberating. It's teaching me not just about machine learning, but also about when to let go of certain practices to prioritise understanding. Sometimes, the most elegant solution isn't the most engineered one—it's the one that most clearly expresses the idea.

After just one week at MLX, I'm already seeing how this minimalist approach can accelerate my learning. By focusing less on engineering ceremony and more on core concepts, I'm able to grasp neural networks more quickly. There's something very elegant about stripping away the layers of abstraction and seeing the raw algorithms at work.
