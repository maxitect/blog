# Software Development vs. Data Science: Coding Standards & Best Practice

Below is a deep dive into how coding practices tend to differ between data scientists and software engineers. In summary, data scientists often prioritise rapid experimentation, readability and reproducibility—using notebooks, self‑documenting scripts and minimal boilerplate—whereas software engineers focus on robustness, scalability and long‑term maintainability, embedding rigorous error handling, automated testing, modular design and formal versioning into their workflows. These differences stem from the exploratory nature of data work versus the production‑orientation of software delivery, though the gap is narrowing with the rise of MLOps and production‑grade data pipelines.

## 1. Development Objectives and Code Lifecycle

### 1.1 Exploratory vs Production‑Grade Code

Data scientists typically write exploratory code to understand datasets, prototype models and iterate quickly. This code lives in notebooks or scripts, emphasises readability over formality, and often assumes clean inputs citeturn0search10.  
Software engineers build production‑grade applications where code must be reliable in the wild, handle unexpected inputs gracefully and scale to user demand citeturn0search2.

### 1.2 Speed of Iteration

Experimentation requires small feedback loops—data scientists favour concise, linear workflows that deliver immediate insights, even if they accrue technical debt citeturn0search3.  
Engineers accept longer setup (tests, CI pipelines) to ensure each change is safe and maintainable over time citeturn0search26.

## 2. Code Quality and Maintainability

### 2.1 Testing and Continuous Integration

Many data science projects lack automated testing or CI/CD, relying instead on occasional manual verification citeturn0search3.  
Software teams embed unit, integration and end‑to‑end tests into their workflow, often gated by pull requests and CI tools to catch regressions early citeturn0search26.

### 2.2 Documentation and Comments

Data scientists lean on self‑documenting code—clear variable names, notebook markdown and minimal comments to avoid drift citeturn0search25.  
Engineers maintain external documentation (README, wikis), inline comments where logic is non‑obvious, and API docs to support large teams and future maintainers citeturn0search2.

## 3. Error Handling and Robustness

Data scripts often “fail fast” on unexpected inputs, since the focus is on data exploration and cleaning citeturn0search4.  
Production code implements structured exception handling, standardized logging and graceful degradation paths to ensure uptime and user‑friendly error messages citeturn0search26.

## 4. Version Control and Reproducibility

### 4.1 Notebooks vs Modular Repositories

Data scientists may version notebooks directly or use ad‑hoc branches, storing data, code and results together citeturn0search4.  
Software engineers adopt strict Git workflows—feature branches, code reviews, semantic versioning—and separate configuration, code and artifacts for clear lineage citeturn0search2.

### 4.2 Dependency Management

Data projects often pin dependencies in a single `requirements.txt` or Conda environment, sufficient for small teams citeturn0search4.  
Engineering projects enforce separate dev/prod dependencies, use lockfiles, containerisation and infrastructure‑as‑code to guarantee consistent environments citeturn0search1.

## 5. Code Style and Design Principles

### 5.1 Readability and Simplicity

Data science code emphasises clear, concise constructs (e.g. Pandas chaining, expressive variable names) over formal design patterns citeturn0search16.  
Engineers apply SOLID principles, design patterns and modular architecture to decouple concerns and support scaling citeturn0search2.

### 5.2 Formatting and Linters

PEP 8 or Google style guides are common in both domains, but data teams may adopt them informally via tools like `ruff` or notebook extensions citeturn0search16.  
Engineering teams enforce linting, formatting (e.g. `pre‑commit`, `clang‑format`) and static analysis as part of the CI pipeline citeturn0search11.

## 6. Collaboration and Review Processes

Data scientists often share results via interactive notebooks, informal reviews and meetings, with code reviews less common citeturn0search7.  
Software engineers rely on structured code reviews, automated quality checks and issue‑tracking to manage large‑scale collaboration citeturn0search11.

## 7. Concrete Code Examples

### 7.1 Data Science Prototype

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
df['log_price'] = np.log(df.price)
model = LinearRegression().fit(df[['log_price']], df.sales)
print(model.coef_)
```

- No error handling, quick inline transformations, and immediate output citeturn0search10.

### 7.2 Production‑Ready Module

```python
import logging
from myapp.config import get_config
from myapp.data_loader import load_data
from myapp.model import Model

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def main():
    try:
        config = get_config()
        data = load_data(config.data_path)
        model = Model(config.model_params)
        result = model.predict(data)
        logger.info("Prediction completed")
    except FileNotFoundError as e:
        logger.error(f"Data file not found: {e}")
    except Exception as e:
        logger.exception("Unexpected error")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

- Structured error handling, logging, separation of concerns and config management citeturn0search26turn0search4.

As you can see, while both roles write code in similar languages, the expectations around robustness, process and scale differ substantially—though modern practices like MLOps are helping bridge the divide.
