        ), a London-based architect and software engineer who swapped designing
        buildings for building software. After spearheading rapid-engineering
        BIM pipelines and crafting bespoke 3D modelling tools, I&apos;ve pivoted
        to building web and AI-powered applications that solve real-world
        problems.

        , I&apos;m fascinated by the intersection of computational design and
        modern web development. Whether I&apos;m debugging collapsed neural
        networks, experimenting with AI-assisted coding workflows, or building
        RAG chatbots, there&apos;s always something interesting to unpack.

        On this blog, you&apos;ll find my thoughts on everything from the lean
        coding style of data scientists to practical frameworks for working with
        AI. I write about the projects that challenge me, the bugs that I
        grapple with, and the occasional breakthrough that makes it worthwhile.
      </p>
      <p>
        Drop me a line if something resonates â€” I&apos;m always up for a chat
        about code, architecture, or how to make machines do clever things.
